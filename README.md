# How would you describe ...

- ## Linked Lists
A structure where each element has at least two parts
- Parts
  - 1. the value of the element
  - 2. the "link" (also know as a pointer) to either the next element, or an indicator for the end of the list (e.g NULL)  
Extra
  - since each list element points to a subsequent one, a linked list doesn't need sequential memory space.

- ## Stacks
Work exactly how they sound: You can only add (push) items to the "top" (end) of the stack. You only remove (pop) items from top (end) of the stack.

- ## Hash Maps
Matches or maps a key, like "Elon Musk"; to a value, like "Tesla". A hash map is like a sandwich. In between the key and the value, is the hash value/hash function. Every key-value pair, has its own hash between it.
- **Ideal** properties
  - Every key maps to exactly one value.
  - The keys in the hashmap are unique. (The value need not be)
- Ideal example (Python)
  - `{"Elon Musk": "Tesla",
  	  "Steve Ballmer" : "Microsoft",
  	  "Satya Nadella": "Microsoft"}`
