# How would you describe ...

- ## Linked Lists
### A structure where each element has at least two parts
- Parts
  - 1. the value of the element
  - 2. the "link" (also know as a pointer) to either the next element, or an indicator for the end of the list (e.g NULL)  
Extra
  - Since each list element points to a subsequent one, a linked list doesn't need sequential memory space.
  - Retrieving any but the first items in the list, require traversing the list from the beginning to find that item.

- ## Stacks
### Work exactly how they sound: You can only add (push) items to the "top" (end) of the stack. You only remove (pop) items from top (end) of the stack. Newly added items are dealt with first - called Last-In-First-Out order. To get to the oldest items (items that were pushed first), you must remove one by one, from the top of the stack. The pointer always points the most recent item in the stack.

- ## Hash Maps
### Match or map a key, like "Elon Musk"; to a value, like "Tesla". A hash map is like a sandwich. In between the key and the value, is the hash value/hash function. Every key-value pair, has its own hash between it.
- **Ideal** situation
  - Every key maps to exactly one value.
  - Keys in the hashmap are unique.
- Ideal example (Python)
  - `{"Elon Musk": "Tesla", "Steve Ballmer" : "Microsoft",
  	  "Satya Nadella": "Microsoft"}`
- Extra
  - A hash function may not provide a unique value for every key.
  - A value is accessed/retrieved by its key.

- ## Trees
### Similar to Linked Lists, Trees are structures where each element has two parts
- Parts
  - 1. Node : holds the value of the element
  - 2. Branches : Links, possibly NULL, that point to subsequent elements
- Properties
  - 1. In a tree, every element has a fixed, maximum number of branches
  - 2. For example in a binary tree, elements can have a max of 2 branches
  - 3. The element that is no a branch of any other is called the parent node
  - 4. Branches of an element are called child nodes
