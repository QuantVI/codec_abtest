# How would you describe ...

- ## Linked Lists
 A structure where each element has at least two parts
   - Parts
    - 1. the value of the element
    - 2. the "link" (also know as a pointer) to either the next element, or an indicator for the end of the list (e.g NULL)
  - Extra
    - since each list element points to a subsequent one, a linked list doesn't need sequential memory space.

- ## Stacks
  - Work exactly how they sound. You only add (push) items to the "top" or the stack. 
  - You only remove (pop) items from top of the stack.

- ## Hash Maps
- ## Trees
- ## Heaps
